> A [ZeroPM](https://zeropm.eu/) R package

The goal of the cactusapi package is to provide a minimal and
lightweight interface to the [CACTUS Chemical Identifier
Resolver](https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure) API services.

The dependency of cactusapi is kept at a bare minimum:
[curl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/curl/index.html) for
handling the API requests.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cccapi from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages(devtools)
remotes::install_github("RaoulWolf/cactusapi")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to get the InChI
representation of caffeine:

``` r
library(cactusapi)

get_representation("caffeine", "StdInChI")
#> [1] "InChI=1S/C8H10N4O2/c1-10-4-9-6-5(10)7(13)12(3)8(14)11(6)2/h4H,1-3H3"
```
